    "There are so many different types of machine learning systems that it is useful to classify them in broad categories, based on the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How they are supervised during training (supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, self-supervised, and others)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly (online versus batch learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points, or instead by detecting patterns in the training data and building a predictive model, much like scientists do (instance-based versus model- based learning)"
